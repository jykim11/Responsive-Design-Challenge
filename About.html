				Farm-to-table (or farm-to-fork) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm-to-table"><b>social
						movement</b></a>
				which promotes serving local food through direct acquisition from the producers.
				This can be accomplished through a direct sales relationship,
				a community-supported agriculture arrangement, a farmer's market,
				a local distributor or by the restaurant raising its own food.
				Farm-to-table often incorporates a form of food traceability where the origin of the food is identified
				to
				consumers.
			</p>
			<p class="grid-p2">
				The farm-to-table movement has arisen with changes in attitudes about food safety, food freshness, food
				seasonality,
				and small-farm economics. Advocates and practitioners of the farm-to-table model frequently cite the
				scarcity of fresh,
				local ingredients; the poor flavor of ingredients shipped from afar; the poor nutritional integrity of
				shipped ingredients;
				the disappearance of small family farms; the disappearance of heirloom and open-pollinated fruits and
				vegetables;
				and the dangers of a highly centralized food growing and distribution system as motivators for their
				decision to adopted
				a more locavore approach to the food system.
